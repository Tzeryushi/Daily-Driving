# Daily-Driving
Small app to give my days direction.

Focus:
Make a scene that can be instanced with custom descriptions, added to a list, edited, and removed
Make a scrolling pool of these added scenes
At the start of each day random elements in the pool will be added to the daily tasks
Accomplishing the tasks for the day will mark a completed day in the calendar
Resets next day

Can edit items with special tags, such as increased priority or permanent slot
Items will gain more weight in the random pool the longer they have gone undone
Rewards for consistency? Pretty colors?
